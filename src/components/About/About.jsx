        The Oxford 3000 is a list of the 3,000 core words that every learner of
        English needs to know. The words have been chosen based on their
        frequency in the Oxford English Corpus and relevance to learners of
        English. Every word is aligned to the CEFR, guiding learners on the
        words they should know at A1-B2 level.

        CEFR stands for the `Common European Framework of Reference` for
        languages, which is a description of the language abilities of students
        at different levels of learning. The CEFR can be used to compare
        standards in language learning and create teaching programmes. It grades
        language skills at six levels: A1 and A2 indicate elementary and
        pre-intermediate levels of ability. B1and B2 indicate lower- and
        upper-intermediate levels. C1 indicates advanced level. C2 indicates
        complete proficiency in the language.

      <h4>What exactly is the Oxford 3000?</h4>

        Unquestionably, expanding one's vocabulary stands as a pivotal facet of
        language acquisition. The more words one commands, the closer they draw
        to linguistic fluency. However, it's crucial to recognize that not all
        words carry equal significance. The most prevalent 1000 words encompass
        75% of all verbal exchanges, while the top 3000 words encapsulate 85%.
        Ascend further to 5000 words, and you'll grasp 98% of both spoken and
        written communicationâ€”a principle applicable across diverse languages.
        The Oxford 3000 includes words from A1 to B2 level; the Oxford 5000
        contains an additional 2000 words at B2 to C1 level.
